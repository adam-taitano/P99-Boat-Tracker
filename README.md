# P99-Boat-Tracker
Goal: An attempt to simulate and provide countdown timers (and perhaps much later a GUI) for boat trips in the Project 1999 emulated version of the classic game EverQuest.

Approach: Build an object oriented, simple yet complete node.js web app. This project is meant to be a work in progress, with an emphasis on attempting best practices and learning how to develop web apps. It may also try to emphasize TDD, maybe.
